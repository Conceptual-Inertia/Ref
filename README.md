## Turing-Completeness

 - Stack-machine: At least two stacks in order to simulate
 ```
 -------------------/                   /------------
  Stack 1          / Turing-Complete   /  Stack 2
  ----------------/                   /------------
  
 ```
 
  - In the same sense, the register-based machine needs two registers to operate too.
